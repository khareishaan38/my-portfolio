## Personal Projects

### PMSense - Deep Dive

**What is PMSense?**
Static RCA and Guesstimate practices online are not very helpful to imitate real interview like conditions for users. Building the future of PM upskilling by moving away from static theory toward high-stakes, real-time simulation.

I built an AI powered RCA simulator where users are thrown into real life like instances and they have to debug/go to the depth of the issue to practice. They can chat with the AI agent as a coworker and at the end get evaluated on their strengths and weaknesses.

Current library includes 5 high-fidelity scenarios: iOS Checkout drops, Organic Search collapse, Notification/DAU divergence, Onboarding Funnel decline, and Fintech Login failures.

**My Role**
End to end, right from conceptualisation to testing to deployment on production I orchestrated the entire project.

**Technical Stack**
Antigravity, Gemini AI APIs, SupaBase, Vercel, Mermaid.js

**Key Metrics & Impact**
Strong early adoption, posted on LinkedIn and got 20+ users in 2 days to try and test the product.

**Challenges & Learnings**
Despite not having a coding background, I quickly grasped the fundamentals of software delivery, used tools like git to create code repositories and basics of API integration to ship a scaleable proper product.

Challenges:
- Ensuring sanity and a stable pipeline to test new features - Built a dedicated local, staging and production environment with separate backend libraries as well
- Ensuring the core engine to work properly without any edge cases - Did extensive regression testing and mapped out all edge cases on a detailed mermaid.js chart to form the core of the rule engine
